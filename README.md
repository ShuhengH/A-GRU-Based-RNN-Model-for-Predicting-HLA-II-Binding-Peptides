GRU-Based RNN Classifier for Predicting HLA-Binding Peptides

## Introduction:

Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) play a critical role in human-acquired immune responses by the recognition of non-self-peptides derived from exogenous bacteria, fungi, virus, and so forth. The accurate prediction of HLA-binding peptides is thus extremely useful for the mechanistic research of cell-mediated immunity and related epitope-based vaccine design. In this work, a simple pan-specific gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural network model was successfully proposed for predicting HLA-binding peptides.
